This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a PyCharm miscellaneous project primarily used for learning and experimentation. It contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks with a focus on data science libraries.

## Environment Setup

The project uses a Python 3.13 virtual environment located in `.venv/` with the following key packages:
- Jupyter Lab/Notebook for interactive development
- pandas, numpy for data manipulation
- matplotlib for visualization
- Standard data science stack

## Common Commands

**Activate virtual environment:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Run Jupyter Lab:**
```bash
jupyter lab
```

**Run Jupyter Notebook:**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

**Install new packages:**
```bash
pip install <package_name>
```

**List installed packages:**
```bash
pip list
```

## Development Workflow

This project appears to be used for experimental and educational purposes. The main development environment is likely PyCharm IDE with Jupyter notebook support for interactive data analysis and visualization.

Files are primarily:
- Python scripts (.py files) for standalone code
- Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) for interactive exploration
